[English](#contents) · [中文版](README.zh-CN.md)

We read the code of every project here, and each description says what it actually does.
Anything unfinished or unclear is tagged `verify` or `adapt`.

**Status:** `ready` = usable as an app or service · `adapt` = needs setup or customization · `infra` = building block · `verify` = unfinished or unclear; check the code yourself before relying on it

**Platform:** `Android` / `iOS` / `Windows` / `Web` … = where it runs · `Self-host` = runs on your own server/machine · `Cloud` = hosted third-party service · `Browser` = extension/userscript · `CLI` = terminal tool · `Any` = host-agnostic · app names (`AstrBot`, `Claude Code`, `Kelivo`, `SillyTavern`…) = plugs into that host

**Two ways to browse:**

- **By building block** (this page): clients, hosts, memory, speech, perception, and so on. Start from the contents below.
- **In plain words**: [the same projects sorted by what you want your companion to do](by-need.md), such as "Help Them Remember You" or "Let Them Reach Out".

## Featured Badge

Projects currently included in this index are welcome to display the badge in their README or website. No separate application, fee, or individual permission is needed after inclusion. Display is optional and is never a condition of inclusion.

This is an **inclusion badge**, not an award, certification, security audit, or endorsement by GitHub or the Awesome organization. It only says that this index lists the project.

- Not listed yet? Follow the [submission guidelines](#contributing) and wait until the entry is merged before presenting the badge as a current inclusion claim.
- Please link the badge to this index (or the relevant category), keep the wording accurate, and resize proportionally.
- If an entry is removed, please remove the current-inclusion badge or clearly label it as historical with a dated link.
- The artwork follows this repository's [CC0 dedication](LICENSE). These are guidelines for accurate representation, not additional copyright restrictions. Reusing the image does not establish inclusion or endorsement.
